Assignment 1: Web Development
Submission Date: 08 April 2017

I had spent 80 hours on developing this website which was quite time consuming but i anyhow managed on doing this work. I approximately spent 4/5hrs per day for completing this work. From this assignment it provided me a brief knowledge about use of HTML5 and CSS3 and our tutor helped us a lot on knowing about CSS3 and HTML5. Almost all the work were of my own. This work has provided me a accurate use of divs on webpages. I have validated each and every css and html files which has shown no warnings and errors. And I have built this website in such a way that it will be attractive for many visitors, it doesn't has any unappleaing color which users are going to hate. In this webpage there are different ideas, information related to me, i have provided much more informations. I had used ATOM code editor for doing my work. 

I had discussed my assignment with my module tutor Mr. Ganesh khatri and got some advice also.

I think on my website my CV page and contact page a bit dizzy because on the CV page i had not used the accurate flex properties instead of using  flex-box i had written flex-direction: column, and on my contact page i had not added too much content and i was thinking to add a map on it but I didn't. And without doing any research i had used color in webpage on my own.
